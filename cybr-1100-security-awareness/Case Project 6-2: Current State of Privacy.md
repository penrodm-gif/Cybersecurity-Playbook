Smartphone Privacy in 2025: Are Current Rules
Enough?
---
Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are pressing Apple and Google to rein in surveillance based
advertising and open up their mobile ecosystems. In Europe, the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and Digital
Services Act (DSA) now shape how “gatekeepers” run app stores, track users, and serve ads. The
DMA compels platform changes (e.g., alternative app stores and payments), and has already forced
Apple to alter iOS in the EU while Apple argues the rules slow feature rollouts and raise
security/privacy risks. Regardless of Apple’s objections, the DMA’s aim is to curb gatekeeper power
and reduce data driven lock in, with real enforcement and fines.
The DSA adds platform wide duties around transparency, risk assessments, and limits on targeted ads
to minors and based on sensitive data important guardrails for the ad tech ecosystem that profits from
behavioral profiling on mobile. Together, DMA/DSA move the market toward less opaque tracking and
more user control, with the EU Commission actively enforcing.
In the U.S., there is still no comprehensive federal privacy law. Federal activity is piecemeal: the FTC
has opened a broad rulemaking on commercial surveillance and data security and recently finalized
stronger COPPA rules that curb monetization of kids’ data and require opt in for targeted advertising to
children—significant, but limited to minors. Meanwhile, a new draft federal bill (successor to
ADPPA/APRA concepts) would preempt state laws and add rights and duties, but it hasn’t passed.
States are filling the gap. California’s CCPA/CPRA (enforced by the CPPA) and the Delete Act push
data minimization, user rights (access, delete, limit), and tighter oversight of data brokers. Colorado’s
Privacy Act goes further by requiring recognition of Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals—making a
browser level “do not sell or target me” opt out legally binding, a practical protection for everyday users.
Competition regulators are also reshaping ad tech. The UK CMA extracted commitments from Google
to ensure its Privacy Sandbox changes (the post cookie ad stack that will interact with
Android/Chrome) don’t simply entrench Google’s position important because design choices at the
browser/OS level can either reduce tracking or just repoint it. Recent CMA reporting continues to
scrutinize effectiveness and market impacts.
Are current rules adequate? Partly. The EU framework is the closest to comprehensive: it constrains
gatekeepers, limits sensitive data targeting, and forces advertising transparency. In the U.S., strong
kids’ protections and state level rights help, and signals like GPC are promising. But key gaps remain:
(1) fragmented U.S. coverage leaves most Americans with uneven rights; (2) the Mobile Advertising ID
(MAID) remains largely opt out, enabling extensive cross app profiling; (3) disclosures and consent
flows are still riddled with dark patterns; and (4) platform changes (like Privacy Sandbox) risk swapping
one tracking method for another unless overseen with teeth.
What more should be done? 1. Make MAID truly opt in (default off) across iOS/Android, with periodic
re permission and straightforward per app scoping—so “tracking” cannot resume silently after updates.
2. Mandate recognition of universal signals (e.g., GPC) nationwide, not just in Colorado, and extend
them beyond the web to in app environments. 3. Ban dark patterns in consent and privacy dashboards;
require standardized, two click controls for location, advertising, and data sharing. 4. Data minimization
by design for SDKs and ad tech: limit collection to what’s necessary for basic ad delivery, forbid
sensitive data inference without explicit, granular opt in. 5. Independent audits and public reporting for
app store tracking tech (SDKs, attribution APIs) and privacy preserving ad systems (e.g., Sandbox) to
verify privacy claims and detect workarounds. 6. Comprehensive U.S. federal law with: clear consumer
rights; strong enforcement (FTC + state AGs); a private right of action; and no weak preemption—a
federal floor that preserves stronger state protections.
Bottom line: The law is finally catching up—especially in the EU and in several U.S. states—but mobile
users are still too exposed to cross app profiling and manipulative consent flows. Regulators should
make MAIDs opt in by default, universal opt out signals mandatory everywhere, and privacy preserving
ad systems independently auditable. With those steps plus a real federal baseline in the
U.S. smartphones can remain innovative while sharply reducing surveillance risks for everyday users.
