VPN Risks
---
Virtual Private Networks are often advertised as privacy and security tools, but their protection depends heavily on the honesty and practices of the companies behind them. A VPN works by routing a user’s internet traffic through an encrypted tunnel to the provider’s server, hiding the activity from local networks and internet service providers. However, most VPNs do not use true end-to-end encryption. This means that the VPN operator itself has the ability to see which websites are visited, and in some cases VPN companies have stored and even shared this information, which undermines the very purpose of using a VPN.

There is a history of VPN providers compromising user security. One example is Hola VPN, which was exposed for selling user bandwidth and failing to provide transparency about how data was used. Another example is PureVPN, which in 2017 admitted to sharing connection logs with law enforcement after claiming to be a “no logs” provider. More recently, several free VPN services were caught logging and leaking user data through unsecured databases. These incidents show that not all VPNs uphold the promise of privacy.

To better understand current practices, I reviewed the Terms of Service and privacy policies of three well-known VPN providers: ExpressVPN, NordVPN, and ProtonVPN. ExpressVPN states that it does not log browsing activity or connection data such as DNS queries or traffic content. NordVPN states that it operates under a strict “no logs” policy and that independent audits have verified this claim. ProtonVPN also emphasizes that it does not track user activity and is based in Switzerland, which has strong privacy protections. Each of these providers claims that no identifying user data is stored on their servers.

The question is how these claims can be verified. Users cannot simply take a company’s word at face value. Verification can come from third-party audits performed by independent security firms that inspect the provider’s infrastructure and confirm that logging practices match their claims. Another form of verification occurs when real-world legal cases test these promises. For example, when authorities request data from a provider and none can be produced, it lends credibility to the provider’s “no logs” statement. Transparency reports and open-source security initiatives also strengthen verification.

Based on my research, the provider I would choose is ProtonVPN. The combination of Switzerland’s strong privacy laws, Proton’s reputation for transparency, and its alignment with a broader ecosystem of privacy-focused services such as ProtonMail makes it more trustworthy than many competitors. While ExpressVPN and NordVPN are also strong options, ProtonVPN’s commitment to open security principles and clear jurisdictional advantages lead me to believe it is the best choice.

In conclusion, VPNs can be powerful privacy tools but only if the provider is trustworthy. History shows that some VPNs have misled users and compromised their security. By selecting a provider with transparent policies, verified audits, and a proven track record, users can reduce their risk and use VPNs as intended to protect their privacy.
