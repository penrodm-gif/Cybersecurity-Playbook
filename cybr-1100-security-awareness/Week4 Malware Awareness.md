As part of our cybersecurity awareness project, our class used a password strength checker to test weak vs. strong passwords. Each team created one weak password and one strong passphrase, then compared how long each would take to crack. We discussed why even strong passwords still need multi-factor authentication (MFA) for extra protection.

For the deliverable, i chose Password Tip: Use a passphrase instead of a single word — for example, a short sentence like "BlueSkyRunsFast#92" — it’s easier to remember and much harder for hackers to crack.

Awareness Month Lab Deliverable Summary

Our group created a Phishing Awareness Campaign to teach students how to spot and avoid fake messages that try to steal personal information. We included real examples of phishing emails, highlighted red flags to look for, and explained how to report suspicious messages. The goal was to help everyone “Stop, Check, and Report” before clicking on anything suspicious.
