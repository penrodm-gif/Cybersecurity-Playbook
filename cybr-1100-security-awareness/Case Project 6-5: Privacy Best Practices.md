Privacy Best Practices: Evaluation and Reflection
---
In this module, several privacy best practices were introduced. To evaluate them, I gave each practice two scores: one numerical score from 1 to 5 reflecting the strength of the privacy protection it offers, and one letter grade from A to F showing how likely I am to follow it. I then compared my responses with those of three friends.

The first best practice was creating strong and unique passwords. I scored this a 5 for strength because it prevents unauthorized access to accounts. I gave myself an A for likelihood since I already use a password manager. My friends gave similar strength scores, but one admitted he reuses passwords and gave himself a C on likelihood.

The second suggestion was turning off location services when not in use. I rated this a 4 for privacy strength and gave myself a B because I usually leave it on for convenience. Two friends gave the same B grade, showing that convenience often outweighs privacy.

The third practice was regularly updating devices and apps. I scored this a 5 for strength and an A for likelihood because updates also patch security vulnerabilities. All three friends also scored high, noting that automatic updates make this practice easy.

The fourth suggestion was using two-factor authentication. I scored it a 5 for strength and an A for likelihood, as I enable it whenever possible. My friends gave it similar ratings but admitted it can be annoying when in a rush.

The fifth practice was limiting what is shared on social media. I gave it a 4 for strength and a B for likelihood because I still share photos occasionally. One friend gave it a C, saying he likes posting updates despite the risks.

From this comparison I noticed a pattern: the strongest practices are not always the easiest to follow. Convenience, habits, and social behavior influence privacy decisions as much as technical knowledge.

I also designed three additional best practices of my own. The first is regularly reviewing app permissions and removing unnecessary access. The second is using a separate email address for online shopping and newsletters to reduce data exposure. The third is clearing cookies and browser history weekly to limit long-term tracking.

Through this project I learned that protecting privacy requires both awareness and discipline. Most people recognize the value of strong protections, but the willingness to follow them consistently varies. Designing habits that balance convenience with security is essential if best practices are to be effective in everyday life.
